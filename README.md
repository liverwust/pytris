Tetris in Python! I found this on my mom's computer. The files were dated 2/26/2007.

Unfortunately the program closes immediately when you lose, so you don't get to see your final score. Also, I'm not sure that it actually increases the speed of the falling blocks, even though it seems to keep track of your "current level."
